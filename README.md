# Terraform Provider for MSSQL

This is an expermient during a competence day at Jayway STHLM.

Hopefully, it can evolve into a [Terraform](https://terraform.io) provider
that lets you provision SQL Server and Database objects like users, logins,
roles and permission grants using Terraform.

I'll be learning from [the official guide on building custom providers](https://www.terraform.io/docs/extend/writing-custom-providers.html).

**DO NOT USE THIS IN PRODUCTION.**
